# Milestone Smart Contract

This project implements a crowdfunding platform using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Each crowdfunding campaign, referred to as a "Mile," has its own smart contract to manage donations and refunds.

## Getting Started

To create a Mile campaign, you'll need to deploy a new instance of the smart contract with the desired fundraising amount, start date, and end date.


## Usage

Once the smart contract is deployed, you can interact with it using the following functions:

1. `donate()`: Allows users to donate Ether to the Mile campaign.
   
2. `refund()`: Refunds the donated Ether to donors if the campaign is closed.
